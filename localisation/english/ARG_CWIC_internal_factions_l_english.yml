 ARG_faction_management_category_desc:0 "Perón has been elected as the most voted president in Argentine history so far in 1946 and he and his wife Evita are promulgating justicialism or Peronism, which is a nationalist labor ideology with full sympathy for Mussolini's Italian fascism and Peronism is an amalgam of political, socio-cultural and economic factions that support him in one way or another.\nThey range from the Unions such as the §RCGT§! that are the backbone of the Peronist movement by history of the movement and that almost all mostly support the ideal Peronism since before perón there was no other president who supported this faction with such strength and political power and then the §CArmed Forces§! would follow which are the other essential column of Peronism since perón being a full military and right-wing can not leave them behind in his decisions. and finally the last two factions that support Peronism would be the Catholic §HChurch§! and the Argentine §LRural Society§! that support Peronism for its corporatist-conservative character and for its traditionalist side at the same time for its classic protectionist side of supporting the countryside before heavy industry.\nA small crossroads between these factions or the repression that Perón gives to one of them could trigger the end of Perón's government in an ultra violent and bloody escalation."
